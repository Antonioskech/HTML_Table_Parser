# üìã HTML Table Parser and Formatter

## üìù Project Description

This project is a **C++ HTML Table Parser and Formatter**.  
It reads a basic HTML-like table structure from a file, parses it into an internal data representation, and displays it neatly formatted in the console.

You can use this project to easily load, modify, and save simple HTML table structures ‚Äî ideal for lightweight table editing directly from C++ without needing a browser!

## ‚ú® Features

Here‚Äôs a list of functionalities implemented in the project:

- ‚úÖ **Parse** an HTML table structure from a `.txt` file
- ‚úÖ **Add** table rows and header cells (`<th>`)
- ‚úÖ **Remove** rows by selecting a row number
- ‚úÖ **Edit** table cells by selecting a row and column number
- ‚úÖ **Visualize** the table neatly in the console
- ‚úÖ **Save** the HTML table back into a `.txt` file
- ‚úÖ **Exit** the program safely (with or without saving changes)

## üìÇ Example Usage

When you launch the program, it will ask you to type the name of the `.txt` file containing your HTML table code.  
After loading, you can use the following commands: `add`, `remove`, `edit`, `print`, `save`, `exit`.

You can find an example table structure inside the `html2.txt` file in the project folder.

## üñ®Ô∏è Print Command
Typing `print` in the console displays your table formatted nicely.

Original HTML table:

Formatted output in the C++ console:

## ‚ûï Add Command
**Syntax:**  `add <rowNumber> <value1>,<value2>,<value3>...`

This command adds a new row to your table at the specified position.

Example:


![C++ AddRow](Project/images/Add_exmpl.png)

## Remove
**Syntax:** `remove <rowNumber>`

This command removes a row you choose in your table.

Example (removing the row we just added):

![C++ RemoveRow](Project/images/Remove_exmpl.png)

## Edit
**Syntax:** `edit <rowNumber> <colNumber> <newValue>`

This command lets you change the value in a cell, chosen by the user.

Example (editing Klaus' age):

![C++ EditRow](Project/images/Edit_exmpl.png)

## Save
When typing in "save", the program will ask you in which `.txt` you want to save the table to. After choosing the file, it will save your table in html code format in your txt file so you can load it again if you want to.

Example:

//insert save example image

The content of the `.txt` file is:

//insert content of html3.txt file

## Exit
"Exit" stops the program. If you didnt type "save" before exiting, the changes would be lost, so make sure to save the changes before exiting the program.
